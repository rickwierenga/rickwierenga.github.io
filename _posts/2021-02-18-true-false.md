title: The True & False Paradox

Consider the following statement:

> My name is Rick.

If I say this statement is not false, is must be true, because *not false = true*. And yes, I'm Rick.

Another statement:

> I'm older than 18.

If I say that statement is not true, it must be false, because *not true = false*. And again, it works. I'm 17.

Easy, right?

Now, consider this statement:

> This statement is false.

We can apply the logic above to draw the following conclusion:

* If the statement were true, we would have a contradiction, hence it is *not true*. Therefore, it must be false.

* If the statement were false, we would also have a contradiction, hence it is *not false*. Therefore, it must be true.

Using the exact same, easy *not* logic, we get two different answers. This shouldn't be possible. Because the statement is neither true nor false, we can't say *not true* or *not false*.

But why can we apply that exact same logic to "I'm older than 18"? Perhaps that statement is also not true nor false. We simply don't know. Maybe I'm $i$ (the imaginary number) years old.

Final question: Does this have anything to do with Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment?

If you know the answer to this mind breaking thought, please let me know.
